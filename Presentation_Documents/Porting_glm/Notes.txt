Since the PS2 does not follow the IEE754 format, GLM would not compile out of the box.

GLM did a bunch of static checks to ensure that floats were IEE 754 compliant, so I 
changed those checks to just check that they were some sort of floating point.

Whether or not this might break something, I don't know.
