# Vector Processing on PS2
## Description
This repository contains the files to a final project submission.

The goal is to exhibit advanced graphics capabilities, in this case on older hardware (Sony PlayStation 2).

The project development timeline is broken down into three milestones and a final delivery with presentation:
- Milestone 1: Primitives on the VU1:
  - Load Vertices
  - Load Texture
  - Send Vertices and Texture to VU1 Memory
  - Process Vertices
     - multiply by VP
     - divide by perspective
     - marry colors and textures to vertices
   - Kick Calculations to Graphics Synthesizer
  - Exit Gracefully
- Milestone 2: Interactive and Procedural VU1:
  - Camera:
   - Create/Load
   - Move
  - Objects:
   - Collision
   - Animation
   - Disappear
   - etc.
- Milestone 3: Functional VU1 App/Game:
  - Tick/Tock Clock
  - Keep Score
  - Interact With GUI
- Deliverable: CS434/535 Lab-like game or app... hopefully multiple!
