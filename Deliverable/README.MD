# Vector Processing on PS2
## Description
This repository contains the files to a final project submission.

The goal is to exhibit advanced graphics capabilities, in this case on older hardware (Sony PlayStation 2).

The project development timeline is broken down into three milestones and a final delivery with presentation:
- November 7, 2022: Milestone 1: Primitives on the VU1:
  - Load Vertices
  - Load Texture
  - Send Vertices and Texture to VU1 Memory
  - Process Vertices
     - multiply by VP
     - divide by perspective
     - marry colors and textures to vertices
   - Kick Calculations to Graphics Synthesizer
  - Exit Gracefully
- November 14, 2022: Milestone 2: Interactive, Procedural, and OOP VU1:
  - Camera (user-updating MVP):
    - Create/Load
    - Move
  - Objects (objects updating objects):
    - Collision
    - Animation
    - Disappear
    - etc.
- November 21, 2022: Milestone 3: Functional VU1 App/Game:
  - Tick/Tock Clock (make it challenging)
  - Keep Score (keep it fun)
  - Interact With GUI (make it welcoming)
- November 28 - December 7, 2002: Deliverable: CS434/535 Lab-like game or app... hopefully multiple "scenes"!
