# Vector Processing on PS2 Vector Unit 1
## Description
This repository contains the files to a final project submission.

The goal is to exhibit advanced graphics capabilities, in this case on older hardware (Sony PlayStation 2).

### The project development timeline is broken down into three milestones and a final delivery with presentation:
Milestone 1: Primitives on the VU1:
 - Load Vertices
 - Load Texture
 - Send Vertices and Texture to VU1 Memory
 - Process Vertices
     -- multiply by VP
     -- divide by perspective
     -- marry colors and textures to vertices
